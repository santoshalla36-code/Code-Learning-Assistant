1. Introduction

**Brief Overview**
This platform is an AI-powered interactive learning environment designed to help users learn programming more effectively. It combines a code editor, real-time AI analysis, and interactive tutorials into a single web-based application.

**Purpose and Target Users**

* **Students:** Gain hands-on practice with guided exercises and instant debugging.
* **Educators:** Create or manage tutorials and track student progress.
* **Self-learners:** Practice coding with AI feedback and skill-based challenges.

---

## 2. Features

* **Code Editor with Syntax Support:** Built-in editor supporting Python, JavaScript, and more, with syntax highlighting and auto-complete.
* **AI-powered Code Analysis and Debugging:** Real-time detection of errors, optimization hints, and code explanations.
* **Interactive Tutorials:** Step-by-step tutorials with embedded code samples and live execution.
* **Difficulty-based Exercise Generator:** Automatically generates exercises based on skill level and selected topics.
* **Real-time Feedback and Suggestions:** AI suggests improvements, best practices, and error fixes instantly.

## 3. System Architecture

* **Frontend:** Responsive UI built using React/HTML/CSS/JS. Integrates code editor (e.g., Monaco Editor).
* **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI) for managing API calls, tutorials, and database operations.
* **AI Integration Flow:**

  1. User writes code in the editor.
  2. Code sent to backend API.
  3. AI module (OpenAI API / CodeBERT) analyzes code.
  4. Feedback returned to frontend in real time.
* **Data Sources:** Tutorials stored in JSON/SQLite. Exercise templates generated dynamically based on topic & difficulty.

---

## 4. Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (React).
* **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI).
* **AI/NLP Tools (Optional):** OpenAI API, Hugging Face transformers (CodeBERT, GPT-based models).
* **Database:** SQLite (lightweight) or PostgreSQL for scalable use.

## 5. Installation Guide

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.9+
* Node.js 18+ (if using React frontend)
* Pip and virtualenv installed

**Setup Steps**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
   cd project
   ```
2. Create virtual environment and install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Run the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 6. Usage Instructions

* **Writing and Analyzing Code:** Open the editor, select language, write your code, click “Run” or “Analyze.”
* **Navigating Tutorials:** Access tutorials from the sidebar; complete interactive steps.
* **Viewing Debugging Suggestions:** Error feedback appears below the editor.
* **Example Workflow:**

  1. Choose topic → read tutorial → complete embedded exercise → receive instant feedback → track progress.

## 7. API Reference

**Endpoints (Example):**

* `POST /analyze_code` → AI-powered code analysis
* `GET /exercises?difficulty=easy` → Generate exercises by difficulty
* `GET /tutorials/{id}` → Retrieve specific tutorial content

**Request Example:**

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "code": "print('Hello')"
}
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "analysis": "Code runs successfully. No errors detected."
}
```

## 8. Content Management

* Tutorials and exercises stored as JSON or in the database.
* Admin panel (optional) to add/update modules.
* Content versioning for easy updates.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

* **Common Issues:**

  * Backend not starting → Check Python version & dependencies.
  * AI feedback delayed → Ensure API keys are valid.
  * Frontend display broken → Clear cache or reinstall npm packages.
